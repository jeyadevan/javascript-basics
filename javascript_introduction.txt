Javascript is a programming language that interact with web elemenets. It consist of

    > Ecmascript
    > DOM
    > BOM

Ecmascript provides code functionality.
DOM- Helps to interact with web elemenets.
BOM- Helps to access browser API to interact with browser.

Earlier javascript engines were built with interpreters.
Modern JavaScript engines were built in JUST IN TIME compiler which converts into bytecode to improve performance.

javascript files can be loaded externally using script tag.
    > async
    > defer
There two attributes helps browser to understand the way to load the script files.

Async- Load the file asynchronously.
Defer - Load the script file after html code parsed.

Javascript is a single threaded and can be asynchronous. It is synchronous by nature and can achieve asynchronous using promises and browser apis.

in javscript 
    -> statement is a term we call for (var a='Hello World');
    -> Blocks we refer to  code inside curly brackets eg. if(true) { return 'Hello World'; }
    -> Identifier is the name we choose for variable, parameter, and function.
    -> single line comments are // comments
    -> Block comments are /* comments */

Javascript is case sensitive in nature.

Undefined vs undeclared variables:
The variable is declared but not initialized with a value. It gives undefined.
var a;
console.log(a); // Output will be undefined

The variable is not declared. It gives reference error.
var a;
console.log(b); // Output will be reference error
