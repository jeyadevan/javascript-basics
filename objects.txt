Object is a collection of key/value pairs and creates a property.
eg:
let emp = {};
let emp = {
    firstname: "John",
    lastname: "Doe",
}
console.log(emp.firstname, emp.lastname);

can access the property with array square brackets
console.log(emp['firstname']);

Adding new property:

emp.middlename = "Ban";
console.log(emp);

Delete property:

delete emp.lastname;
console.log(emp);

can check the property avaialble in the object,

property in object-
console.log('middlename' in emp);

if the property is having word with multiple words it should be accessed with square brackets and enclosed with string quote.
let emp = {
    'max age': 56,
    firstname: "John",
}
console.log(emp['max age']);

The property and objects can be copied from one object to another object.

let emp = {
    name: "John",
    age: 56,
}

let stu = emp;
stu.age = 35;
console.log(stu);
